        <h2>Bevy FPS Project</h2>
        <p>I'm currently working on a Bevy Rust game, it took me 5 days to get a first person controller working so i guess it's gonna take a lot of time until that gets released.</p>

        <h2>Bean: Godot FPS Game Project</h2>
        <p>This was a FPS game project just like my Bevy FPS Project. I abandoned it when I dropped Godot and started learning bevy. A moment of silence for this project that did not make it.</p>

        <h2>Old CrabbyDisk.net</h2>
        <p>That was the old version of CrabbyDisk.net. It actually looked pretty good, but since I like learning new stuff, I decided to kill it and start working on this version of the website made with SvelteKit. A moment of silence for that website that did not make it.</p>
